    st.markdown('‚ÄúTell me about yourself,‚Äù or questions like it, are common at the beginning of interviews as they ease both you and the interviewer into the interview. It allows the interviewer to hear a short, summed up version of your background and skills, and it gives them insight into what experience and qualifications you think are most relevant to the position you‚Äôre interviewing for.')
    st.markdown('It‚Äôs also not lost on employers that, although a common interview question, it still has the tendency to fluster or stump candidates. By answering this question well, you are setting the tone for the interview as someone who is confident, good under pressure and attentive to the qualifications of the position.')
    st.markdown('Some interviewers might approach this question as an icebreaker by using your response to spark casual conversation to get to know you better, while others may move directly into other interview questions after you respond.')

    st.markdown('With these kinds of questions, interviewers are usually trying to learn three things: First, they want to know how you behaved in a real-world situation. Second, they want to understand the measurable value you added to that situation. Finally, they are trying to learn how you define something like ‚Äúpressure at work‚Äù‚Äîa concept different people might interpret differently.')
    st.markdown('Success in a behavioral interview is all about preparation. There aren‚Äôt necessarily wrong answers. These questions are aimed at getting to know the real you. The important thing is to be honest and to practice structuring your responses in a way that communicates what you have to offer.')

    st.markdown('Internships allow you to get hands-on practice for important skills like problem solving and teamwork. They also help you get more job offers with a higher starting salary after graduating and connect you with mentors who can give you job-search advice. They even give you more information to decide on your major and classes while you\'re in school.')
